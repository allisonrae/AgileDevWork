# __Project Proposal__ 

## __Project Title:__ 
Always Learning 

## __What and Why?:__ 
I would like to build an app for teachers in hospitals. Every hospital that provides long term support for child patients provides a teacher so that they don't fall behind in school. I think that this education is important and also provides children with a touch of optimism for the patients that their lives will return to normal and they will eventually return to school. There isn't a single application out there that supports this specific kind of teaching, which usually only involves teaching a student for an hour or so per day and streamlines the relationship between teachers, nurses, and patients.

## __For Whom?:__ 
The app would be primarily for teachers in hospitals that care for children long term, but nurses would need to use it as well. 

## __How?:__ 
Essentially what the app would do is allow nurses to input a child's medical schedule and general information into a profile fit with a calendar for that child/patient. Then the teacher of that child would be able to access the profile, and could plan their lessons according to when treatments or operations are planned, the severity of those treatments, and how the child is feeling. Consider a child who has been hospitalized for a few months due to some form of cancer - this app would allow the teacher to perhaps plan easier lessons on chemotherapy days and lessons that are more difficult on days the child is feeling better. Down the road, we could even add functionality for the student patients as well so that they could access their own schedule and perhaps materials as well on the app.

## __Scope:__ 
This project is certainly not to easy, it might be too ambitious but I believe it is scalable. We could start out with minimal functionality, and add more as we progress.
